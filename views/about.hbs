			<h2>About</h2>
			 <p>Hi, My name is Manpreet Singh. I am from Punjab, India. Currently I am studying a diploma called Computer Programming in Seneca College. It is a 2 year of course in which I think I am going to learn a lot of new skill set like doing coding and also creating webpages however when I start doing this cousre it seems difficult for me because I have no background in coding and in web development but I must say with practice we can learn new things easily. Moreover, I also like to listen music, playing games and spending time with my friends and family. Furthermore, after completing my diploma in computer programming I want to pursue my career in coding field and after sometime I would like to complete my Bachelor's Degree so that I can learn some more new skills and so that I can get elgible for higher level of jobs like working as a senior Computer programmer. Everyday as I learn more and more my interest in coding and web development getting bigger and bigger.</p>
